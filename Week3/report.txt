SLIDE COURSEL REPORT 
WEB PROGRAMMING LAB

Heriot-Watt University (ls2092)

As instructed in the lab sheet, I first of all replaced the banner section with the code provided.
After that I declared a variable named SlideIndex for index of the array and initialised it to zero.
A constant variable timeInterval was also declared for the slideshow which was set to 2500.
And after that a function was written to change images on the slideshow. Each time an image was changed 
the index was incremented with wrap around of the array so that the slideshow keeps on repeating.

In conclusion, I faced no challenges while implemeting it as the lab sheet clearly explained,
step by step, what to do.
